INDIVIDUAL ASSISTANCE BRANCH provides recovery assistance following a disaster that impacts individuals and households, businesses, and/or the agricultural community. Coordinates recovery assistance with federal, state, local, and voluntary/nonprofit entities. The Individual Assistance recovery process involves the following:	EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE through voluntary agencies, such as the American Red Cross or Salvation Army, can include emergency housing in the form of shelters or hotel vouchers, food, or clothing during any significant emergency. Contact local voluntary agency. 	INSURANCE: Individuals should contact their insurance company to report their loss. Ask insurance agent or representative to help with the claim. For assistance with insurance issues, contact the California Department of Insurance at 1-800-927-HELP (4357) or by visiting their website. 	FEDERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS: Governor may determine recovery is beyond the resources of state and local governments and can request federal assistance by seeking a Presidential Declaration. Declaration initiates Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assistance process through its Individuals and Household Program (IHP). This includes "Housing Needs"  (temporary housing, repair, replacement, construction) and "Other than Housing Needs" (see website for inclusions).	STATE SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT PROGRAM (SSGP): Administered by the California Department of Social Services (CDSS), provides grant funds to assist people who have suffered damage in a disaster area declared by the President, and when FEMA\'s IHP is implemented. There is no separate application process, as FEMA will refer applications to CDSS when the maximum assistance from FEMA\'s IHP has been reached. As with the FEMA IHP, SSGP cannot duplicate assistance from any governmental agency or personal insurance.	UNMET NEEDS: Once a disaster survivor has exhausted all other assistance programs, voluntary agencies may implement programs to assist people with necessary remaining unmet needs. Local Long Term Recovery Committees may be formed within a disaster area to coordinate resources for recovery. Additionally, Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters (VOADS) may be able to assist individuals and families with their recovery efforts. Contact regional VOAD group for further information.'

Library Service: Over 75% of the materials circulated each year are donated by members of the community. Bestsellers, westerns, poetry, African-American fiction and non-fiction as well as books focused on self-help and recovery are all very popular.	They bring in paperbacks only; no hardbacks are allowed.  If you have paperbacks or recent issues of popular magazines in good condition that you would like to donate please phone 510-745-1485.	Literacy Tutoring: Volunteer literacy tutors are provided to inmates who read and write below the 8th grade level. They are not looking for any particular educational background in prospective volunteers, but it is important that they be flexible, patient, caring individuals who believe they have as much to learn as to teach. They also ask that prospective volunteers not seek to promote any political or religious platform within the jail. They ask that those interested in becoming volunteer jail tutors participate in a screening interview to qualify.	The Alameda County Sheriff\'s Department will conduct a security review for all volunteers working in the jails. Volunteers will also be required to attend a security orientation at the Alameda County Jail â€“ dates TBA. Prospective volunteers should call (510) 745-1490.	Start with a Story Program: â€œStart With a Storyâ€ delivers story times, free books, and family literacy activities to children, ages 1-16 years old, who visit at the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin, and at the Glenn Dyer Jail in downtown Oakland. Prospective volunteers can contact 510-745-1486 for more information.'
